# Sign Language Interpretation

Sign Language is a necessity for differently-abled people especially for deaf people since it's their way of communication. Keeping in mind this challenge, I have tried to implement sign language alphabets using MATLAB platform and Deep Learning concepts!

# RESULT

As soon as a user do a sign of alphabet like, I am doing sign of alphabet "b" so data-set will be evaluated and sign gets interpreted which gives user the letter!
